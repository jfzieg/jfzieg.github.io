## WIP Website stuff
Mostly a sandbox to learn some css and web design. Not gonna be much of anything for a while.

### Acknowledgements
My site design was greatly influenced by [cadars'](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) single html page website. [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) was also an amazing resource for additional visual tweaks.
