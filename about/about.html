<h1>about</h1>

<div>
<p>Interested in various applications for computer science in space tech, computational biology and physics.</p>

<p>I’m graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UVM in May, 2019. I’ll be taking a full-time job at the Outdoor Gear Exchange, and living in Burlington, VT. Interests are pretty outdoorsy, with my main hobbies lying in rock climbing, cycling and yoga. Film, music, and books are also pastimes of mine.</p>

<p>Next steps are hopefully to continue studies into a Masters of Science at UVic.<br><h3>pictures</h3></p>
