<h1>about</h1>

<body>
<p>I'm interested in various areas including Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Computational Physics, Aerospace, and Robotics. </p>

<p>I completed  a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/">UVM</a> in May, 2019. Since then, I took a year off of academia to pursue rock-climbing and backcountry skiing, while working at the <a href="https://www.gearx.com/">Outdoor Gear Exchange</a> in Burlington, VT. Going by my  pre-pandemic plan, I would currently be studying for a masters at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a> in BC, Canada.</p>

<p>In the meantime I'm currently looking for work
